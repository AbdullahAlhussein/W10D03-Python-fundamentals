# Python fundamentals lab 

## Task 1:
Write a program to display all prime numbers within a range spcified by user input 

A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers. 

Examples: 
* 10 is not a prime number because it can be made by 2×5 = 10
* 11 is a prime number because no other whole numbers multiply together to make it.

* Given range: 
start = 50
end = 100

* Expected output:
Prime numbers between 25 and 50 are:
53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97
